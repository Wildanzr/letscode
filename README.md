## Installation

To install LetsCode, make sure you have installed Docker on system. Docker is a platform for running and managing containers, which are lightweight and portable units that encapsulate an application and its dependencies.

Once Docker is installed, follow these steps to install LetsCode:  

1. Create an `.env` file:
    - Create a new file named `.env` in the same directory as your `.env.sample` file.
    - Copy the contents of the `.env.sample` file and replace the placeholders with the actual values that you want to use.
    - Save the `.env` file.

2. Build the application with Docker Compose:
    - Open a terminal or command prompt in the same directory as your `docker-compose.yml` file.
    - Run the command `docker-compose build`. This will build all the Docker images defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

3. Run the application with Docker Compose:
    - In the terminal or command prompt, run the command `docker-compose up -d`. This will start the containers and run the application in detach mode.
    - You can see the log of containers by executing the command `docker logs letscode-nameofimage`
